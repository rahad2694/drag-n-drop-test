## Project Features:

- Draggable property added in each colored boxes.
- Dragging is completed following the bellow conditions:
  - Two same colored boxes can't be on the same column. For example, the first and
    second columns each contain a green box. So we can't drag the green box from the
    first column to second but it's draggable to the third column.
  - The drag and drop should only be limited to the column area. If we drag a box and
    drop it somewhere which is not a column, it should go back to the column where it
    was dragged from.

### Technologies used:
